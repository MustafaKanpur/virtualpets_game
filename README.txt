How to run the game through Eclipse (It works best on Eclipse):
The game is run through the MainMenu Class, just execute it like normal after installing OpenCSV
We were not able to get it to work through a executable Jar file, so running it through Eclipse is the best way to play the game.

User Guide:
This is a virtual pet care game. You can select different pets depending on the desired difficulty. Gameplay involves using different commands to keep your pets vital statistics high, as they tick down over time. If the pet reaches zero on any of these statistics, then a penalty is applied to the player's score, and they have to use a command to bring the pet back.

Commands can be clicked, or a keyboard shortcut can be used. E for exercise, P for play, V for vet, S for sleep.

The game will save at various points automatically. Whenever a command is used the game saves. Whenever the player exits the game saves, and so forth. The player doesn't really need to save manually. The player can then load this save file.


Parental Controls:
There are also parental controls, allowing for restrictions on time of day that the game can be played, along with limits for how long the session is.

There is a password for accessing the parental controls
